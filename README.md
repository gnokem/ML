# ML
playing with Machine Learning algorithms and ideas in Python and R

this file is a collection of code-files from my work playing with kaggle data-sets
a while back there was an "All-State" (Insurance company) run competition
they provided a dataset with insurance data and asked programmers to code predictive algorithms
I tried neural nets, boosted trees, knn, genetic algorithms etc., in python and R - these are those code files
these files may not be useful as is, but I think I can reuse code snippets in other projects
